That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T). An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n* Strong communication skills, ability to articulate complex ideas.\n* Over 4 years of experience leading high-performance growth / marketing teams.\n* A stickler for details, who can work with the team to ensure product positioning and messaging is consistent across every touchpoint.\n* Deep understanding and passion for team productivity and collaboration tools.\n* Familiarity with Google Anlaytics, Ahrefs, SEMRush and other content performance tools.\n* Someone who appreciates a deep dive into the data, but understands how to blend metrics, best practices, and intuition.\n\nTo learn more about who we are, our culture, and whether Taskade is the right place for you, please contact john@taskade.com"}],"comparisons":[{"competitor_name":"Airtable","slug":"free-airtable-alternative","excerpt":"Taskade is the best free alternative to Airtable.","content":"## What is Airtable?\n\n### The company history\n\nAirtable is a spreadsheet-like app that lets you create and share tables with team members and clients.

Evernote began as a Windows note taking and web clipping application. It allowed users to easily copy and paste things you found on web pages into your own personal desktop notebook. \n\nWhen Phil Libin stepped into the CEO role, the company shifted its focus to being an online tool focused on the web, smartphones, and Apple Mac. The Evernote web service launched in June of 2008 and by July of 2011 it boasted 11 million users. Today, it has a user base of over 225 million.\n\nEvernote allows its users to create notes as well as edit and share them with others. It features advanced search capabilities, document scanning and annotation, as well optical character recognition.\n\nIt does have some team collaboration features and limited task features with reminders, but most of these features are for paid users only. That is one of the big differences between Evernote and the other top note taking applications on the market today.\n\nFor strictly note taking and web clipping, Evernote is a solid tool for most users. If you are looking for project management and task management features, its options are not very robust. There are tools out there that do task management much better and even that combine notes and task management better.","meta_title":"Evernote vs Taskade | Evernote Alternatives | Taskade","meta_description":"Taskade is a free alternative to Evernote that offers online note-taking, task management, and project management for personal use or to collaborate with your team."},{"competitor_name":"Google Docs","slug":"free-google-docs-alternative","excerpt":"Taskade is the professional's alternative to Google Docs.","jumbotron_title":"The Professional Google Doc Alternative","jumbotron_subtitle":"Collaborate, Chat and Present Without Hassle","competitor_price":"Paid","taskade_price":"Free","logo":"static_images/comparisons/goog-docs.png","feature_sections":[{"features":[{"name":"The Visual Playground","tooltip_text":"Availability of templates and their ease of use.","competitor_offering":"No templates available","taskade_offering":"Develop customizable templates"},{"name":"Own Your Workspace","taskade_offering":"Fully customizable workspace and progress tracking","tooltip_text":"The ability to custom tailor your workspace and project structure to how you like it.

According to Butterfield, the word Slack is an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversations and Knowledge and the name replaced its previous name of Linefeed. \n\nThe tool was developed by Tiny Speck to improve communication among team members during its development of Glitch, an online game. \n\nSlack is a messaging app designed primarily for business applications. It aims to bring people together to work and communicate as a team. In really simple terms, Slack aims to replace email as a more efficient and reliable means of communication.\n\nFor people who have been around chat programs online for a while and are familiar with IRC-style chat rooms, they will feel right at home with Slack. It offers a lot of the same features. It allows users to set up channels (kind of like chat rooms) that can be organized by topic. Users can also create private groups, and share files right inside of Slack. It also has direct messaging options. \n\nAll of this content is searchable within Slack.\n\nOrganizations can group users into teams. These teams can join a “workspace” via a specific URL or by the admin inviting them.\n\nSlack integrates with many third-party services including Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, Zendesk, and Zapier.\n\nAlong with its desktop application, Slack can also be used across mobile devices through its iOS and Android apps.\n\nAlthough designed as a business application, Slack has also been adopted by many community groups in lieu of message boards and even social media organizations like Facebook Groups.","meta_title":"Slack Alternatives | Taskade vs Slack | Taskade","meta_description":"As part of its full suite of project and task management tools, Taskade offers full chat and video communication features and can be used as an alternative to Slack for your team."},{"competitor_name":"Smartsheet","slug":"free-smartsheet-alternative","excerpt":"Taskade is the Smartsheet alternative for remote teams.","jumbotron_title":"Remote Work Made Simple","jumbotron_subtitle":"Share and collaborate with a push of a button","competitor_price":"Paid","taskade_price":"Free","logo":"static_images/comparisons/smartsheet.png","feature_sections":[{"features":[{"name":"The Visual Playground","tooltip_text":"Availability of templates and their ease of use.","competitor_offering":"Develop spreadsheet orientated templates","taskade_offering":"Develop customizable templates"},{"name":"Own Your Workspace","taskade_offering":"Fully customizable workspace and progress tracking","tooltip_text":"The ability to custom tailor your workspace and project structure to how you like it.

Trello was developed in 2011 by Fog Creek Software and sold to Atlassian in 2017. It is currently developed by Trello Enterprise, an Atlassian subsidiary.\n\nWhen it launched, it was named one of “The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven’t Heard of Yet” by Wired magazine. By May of 2016, Trello boasted 1.1 million daily active users and 14 million total signups. \n\nThe tool can create kanban boards and has applications for both personal and business use. Teams can collaborate on boards together through desktops, tablets, and smartphones making it useful for software project management, web design work, product roadmaps, and more. \n\nKanban boards are made up of columns, which Trello allows you to name. The columns commonly are named things like To Do, Working On, Need Help, Ready For Review, and Done. As a task moves through these stages, its “card” is moved to the next column. \n\nEach card contains everything that is needed for that task, including notes, communication about the current or next steps, and files. Cards can also be tagged to create another layer of organization.\n\nTrello only offers kanban style boards for managing your tasks, so it’s not for everybody. However, if you like kanban boards, few applications do it better.","meta_title":"Trello Alternatives | Taskade vs Trello | Taskade"},{"competitor_name":"Whimsical","slug":"free-whimsical-alternative","excerpt":"Taskade is the best alternative to Whimsical for data visualization","jumbotron_title":"Visualization Of Data Made Simple","jumbotron_subtitle":"Map out your workflow easily","competitor_price":"Paid","taskade_price":"Free","logo":"static_images/comparisons/whimsical.png","feature_sections":[{"features":[{"name":"The Visual Playground","tooltip_text":"Availability of templates and their ease of use.","competitor_offering":"Develop database diagram templates","taskade_offering":"Develop customizable templates"},{"name":"Own Your Workspace","taskade_offering":"Fully customizable workspace and progress tracking","tooltip_text":"The ability to custom tailor your workspace and project structure to how you like it.

As with many such tools, Workflowy was born out of Jesse’s frustration with the lack of tools that could meet his needs. This frustration along with his prior experience in project management led to the creation of Workflowy.\n\nIn the simplest terms, you can think of Workflowy as an online tool that creates lists. You begin with a page that looks like a typical word-processing program. Unlike competitors, you do not need to open “notebooks” to start creating. Everything is part of one giant list. Each item can have sub-lists, and those sub-items can have sub-lists of their own.\n\nThis infinite nesting structure lets you organize whatever you want, however you want. Workflowy does an excellent job of allowing you to zoom in on any single item no matter how deep it goes. Tags make things easy to find and group together, while kanban boards can give you another way to track tasks through multiple stages to completion.\n\nWorkflowy is more than just lists though. It can be used for task management. Each item in your lists can be checked off as done. It also allows for collaboration. You can invite others into your notepad and everyone can work off the same list from their computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can upload files and images to share with your team or store for yourself.","meta_title":"Workflowy Alternatives | Taskade vs Workflowy | Taskade","meta_description":"Taskade is a free alternative to Workflowy offering task management and team collaboration.
